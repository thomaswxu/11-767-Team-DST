Lab 8: Group work on projects
===
The goal of this lab is for you to make progess on your project, together as a group. You'll set goals and work towards them, and report what you got done, chaellenges you faced, and subsequent plans.

Group name: DST
---
Group members present in lab today: Saloni Mittal, Dhruv Naik, Thomas Xu

1: Plan
----
1. What is your plan for today, and this week? 
> 1. Set up HiTUT repo on Jetson, measure latency/power/etc., apply early-exit techniques to speed-up inference, similar to this paper [BERT Loses Patience: Fast and Robust Inference with Early Exit](https://proceedings.neurips.cc//paper/2020/file/d4dd111a4fd973394238aca5c05bebe3-Paper.pdf)
> 2. Quantize ALFRED Seq2Seq model on Jetson, and compare vs. unquantized version (latency, size, power consumption, etc.)
> 3. Benchmark accuracy and efficiency metrics with decreasing vocabulary size, re-trained models with lower hidden dimensions and compare performance.


2. How will each group member contribute towards this plan?
> - Saloni: Focus on 1 
> - Dhruv: Focus on 3, 2
> - Thomas: Focus on 2, 3

2: Execution
----
1. What have you achieved today / this week? Was this more than you had planned to get done? If so, what do you think worked well?  


3. What were the contributions of each group member towards all of the above?
> - Saloni: 
> - Dhruv: 
> - Thomas: 

3: Next steps
----
1. Are you making sufficient progress towards completing your final project? Explain why or why not. If not, please report how you plan to change the scope and/or focus of your project accordingly.

> Yes

2. Based on your work today / this week, and your answer to (1), what are your group's planned next steps?
> Next Steps:
> 1. ...

3. How will each group member contribute towards those steps? 
> - Saloni: 
> - Dhruv: 
> - Thomas:
